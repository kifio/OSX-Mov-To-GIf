**MOV to GIF**

Simple GUI wrapper around ffmpeg, created for one simple goal: Convert screen records to small .gif animations.
Just activate it, drag .MOV file to active window and get results on my desktop! (**Path to gifs are hardcoded**)

Application required installed ffmpeg.
It's the second app in my **#1week1app** challenge.
