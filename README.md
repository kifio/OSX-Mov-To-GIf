**MOV to GIF**

Simple GUI wrapper around ffmpeg, created for one simple goal: Convert screen records to small .gif animations.

Just activate it, drag .MOV file to active window and get results on your desktop!

After closing the main window, the application will be available in the status bar, so you could easily open it at any moment.

Application required installed ffmpeg.
Just use `brew install ffmpeg` for getting it.

This is the second app in my **#1week1app** challenge.
